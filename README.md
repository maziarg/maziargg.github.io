## Projects

**Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate theme is designed to get rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.**

## Research

- Available as a **theme gem** and **GitHub Pages** theme
- Clear and elegant design that can be used out of the box or as solid starting point
- Tested in all major browsers, including **IE and Edge**
- Built in **Service Worker** so it can work offline and on slow connections
- **Configurable colours** and typography in a single settings file
- Extensive set of **shortcodes** to include various elements; such as buttons, icons, figure images and more
- Solid **typographic framework** from [Sassline](https://sassline.com/)
- Configurable navigation via a single file
- Modular Jekyll components
- Post category support in the form of a single post index page grouped by category
- Built in live search using JavaScript
- **Contact form** built in using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/features/#forms)
- Designed with **[Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/)** in mind
- Has 9 of the most popular networks as performant sharing buttons
- Has documentation
