## About
  I am a final year of PhD. student at <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca//">Reasoning and Learning Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca//">McGill</a> and at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> working with <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/doina-precup/">Doina Precup</a>.

My broad research domains are machine learning, reinforcement learning and data privacy. My current reserach focus is on developing privacy-preserving machine learning systems. My goal is to design and develope privacy-aware machine learning algorithms that serve as the main core of AI systems. 

During my studies, I designed and developed the first generation of privacy-preserving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. I also developed the first membersbership infrence attacked against off-policy RL systems.
## Projects

**Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate theme is designed to get rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.**

## Research

- Available as a **theme gem** and **GitHub Pages** theme
- Clear and elegant design that can be used out of the box or as solid starting point
- Tested in all major browsers, including **IE and Edge**
- Built in **Service Worker** so it can work offline and on slow connections
- **Configurable colours** and typography in a single settings file
- Extensive set of **shortcodes** to include various elements; such as buttons, icons, figure images and more
- Solid **typographic framework** from [Sassline](https://sassline.com/)
- Configurable navigation via a single file
- Modular Jekyll components
- Post category support in the form of a single post index page grouped by category
- Built in live search using JavaScript
- **Contact form** built in using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/features/#forms)
- Designed with **[Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/)** in mind
- Has 9 of the most popular networks as performant sharing buttons
- Has documentation

## Awards

Here are a few examples of Alembic out in the wild being used in a variety of ways:
